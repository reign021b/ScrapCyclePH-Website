          In today's fast-paced world, the issue of waste management has become
          increasingly critical. With landfills overflowing and environmental
          degradation on the rise, innovative solutions are urgently needed to
          address this pressing challenge. Enter ScrapCycle—a groundbreaking
          initiative that is revolutionizing waste management practices and
          paving the way for a greener, more sustainable future.
