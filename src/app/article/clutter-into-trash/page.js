          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Clutter Happens</h2>
          In today's fast-paced world, it's easy for clutter to accumulate.
          Whether it's due to a busy schedule, a lack of proper disposal
          options, or simply not knowing where to start, clutter can quickly
          take over your space. Not only does this create a chaotic environment,
          but it can also lead to increased stress and decreased productivity.
